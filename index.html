Set two decades after the second film, the survivors from previous events swore to take revenge by taking down The Bride.</p><p>While maintaining consistency with the previous two films, design creativity should not be limited. The initial design theme includes a blue color tone or monochromatic tone with elements of red and yellow. The expected design includes posters that convey a sense of strength, dominance, and confidence overall. The text is powerful due to being set in uppercase, the colors contrast successfully, and the image is assured and no-nonsense. The main promotional posters from the previous two films have strong vibrant colors, reflecting the intense and action-focused genre. The design direction for this project will be based on the established styling and will continue to use vibrant colors. To create a strong consistency, complementary colors will be used, indicating that the third color option based on a color wheel, after red and yellow, is blue.

            <p>Stop Haunting Mother Nature is a advertisement series for <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="_blank">WWF</a>, also known as The World Wide Fund for Nature Inc., focuses on having vital environment awareness elements to suit the organization's objective. The direction focuses on the negative impact of uncontrolled human activities instead of the benefits/positive impacts of controlled human activities. This increases the visual impact and makes a stronger impression. The outcome also aims to include surprise elements for memorable impacts. A series of classic and modern horror film posters were chosen to depict the morale of the poster designs: The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, and Halloween. These films were critically praised on their own, with strong cultural influence and relevance, further making more vital impressions. The visual elements and taglines from the original posters are all replaced with details relevant to WWF.</p><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/" target="_blank">The Silence of the Lambs</a> is restyled to become "The Silence of Nature". This poster shows the main character wearing a mask, an indicator of modern air pollution, instead of hinting at the recent pandemic, in which, coincidentally, wearing a mask is a norm. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">The Shining</a> is restyled to become "The Humans" as a metaphor for humans being the haunting element, while a freaked-out tree represents innocence and purity. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_q_halloween" target="_blank"> Halloween</a> is restyled to "October 21", the day Thomas Edison invented the commercial light bulb. This hints at the beginning of the industrial revolution, which is also the beginning of mass pollution caused by human activities.</p><p>The posters are paired with the tagline "Stop haunting mother nature," reflecting the posters' origins as horror films. The outcome is a series of designs with solid pop culture relevance and a sense of familiarity with hidden surprise elements. The posters are also very subtle regarding the nature-related theme to avoid generic nature-related poster styling, making the visual outcome more appealing and unique, which suits WWF's usual advertising direction well. The focused message of this advertisement series is to implement the horror elements onto humans ourselves, having humans as the horror elements/creatures that terrorize the innocent by producing pollution to nature. This emphasizes the act of pollution being at fault by having humans at the antagonists’ side in the poster.</p><p>The call to action includes WWF’s website and a hotline number, yet the main element that triggers action is to have a memorable experience for viewers of the design outcome. Looking at the design itself, the main silhouette of the original film posters are still highly visible, only with minor parts revised to support the series’ theme: Stop haunting mother nature. This maintains a strong horror element while connects the relevance to preserving nature and reduce pollution. Multiple design elements in the design links the ads as a series, including:<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;A consistent branding and texts at the bottom of each ads<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;The consistency of using classic/iconic horror films as the base of the design<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Having humans as the antagonists, nature as the protagonists<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;sA same message to viewers: increase the awareness of stop polluting nature

            <p>X̱wáýx̱way Album is a vinyl soundtrack album dedicated for <a href="https://stanleyparkecology.ca/" target="_blank">Stanley Park</a> located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. X̱wáýx̱way, rendered in English as Xway xway and Whoiwhoi, is a First Nations village site, located in what is now Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The village was home for many Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-waututh people, but after European colonization began in the Vancouver area, the inhabitants were forced to re-locate to nearby villages. The village was named for a mask ceremony; thus, the best translation of x̱wáýx̱way would be "masked dance performance". With its long and rich history, Stanely Park is no stranger to being regarded as one of the best tourist attractions in Vancouver. However, Stanley Park is more than just a tourist attraction; it is a piece of living history that behold many transition phases of Vancouver since the beginning. Being preserved and taken care of very well, its presence indicates the respect and appreciation provided by Vancouver. </p><p>The nature within the park's soul is beyond verbal description and visual representation; hence, the idea of having a vinyl album is proposed to provide a more profound reflection of Stanley Park's resourceful and iconic status. The vinyl album consists of six individual parts, which are all located in Stanley Park itself. These six themes include:<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous history, represented by <a href="https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/totems-and-first-nations-art.aspx" target="_blank">Totem Poles</a><br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods, represented by woods<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Waves, represented by Siwash Rock<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Land, represented by Prospect Point<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind, represented by Seawall<br>&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;Modernization, represented by Lions Gate Bridge.</p><p>Each of these separated themes tells a story from the past, which indicates different time eras to show the significant events and incidents that happened in the park, crafting the Stanley Park that we all know today. In addition, the pieces of vinyl have soundtracks dedicated to individual themes to be recorded on or inspired by Stanley Park. The soundtracks aim to provide an experience as if audiences are in Stanley Park, enjoying the breeze of nature from the beautiful sceneries and natural environments. The Stanley Park Vinyl Album is a tribute album to showcase the park's history and attractions. Rather than being a guidebook for tourists, the album serves as a collector's edition product. The decision to use vinyl instead of modern CDs is to strengthen the presence of Stanley Park's long history. Furthermore, this also indicates that the contemporary rendition of Stanley Park is just a minor part of its long history.</p><p>The outcome is a vinyl album designed with a monochromatic retro theme, with the six unique themes bound together into one extensive collection. The album, by its looks, shall be a relatively exclusive and premium item produced in minimal numbers. My vision for this album is to be utilized during fundraising events, which will ultimately benefit the park by raising funds and awareness to preserve its precious natural elements. The design aims to be something other than mass-produced at a low cost or convenience for bringing around. Instead, it serves as a vision of how a designer’s work can bring people together by understanding the irreplaceable value of mother nature, which brought us beautiful things that can be experienced through visual and hearing, as reflected by the vinyl in the album.

Proudly contributing to our team's success, I played a vital role in securing a position among the top 10 finalists. Nexus transcends the conventional notion of a bench; it embodies the essence of Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRT), highlighting the significance of linkage, continuity, and connectivity in public spaces.
